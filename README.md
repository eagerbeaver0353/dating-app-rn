### üôã‚Äç What is Pegava?

Pegava is supposed to be a dating app. I made it back at the pandemic's beginning but was never released. So I'm making it open source so the community can take a look and maybe use it better. I rapidly refactored it recently to make sure things are up to date after more than a year without updates.


### üë®‚Äçüî¨ What are the technologies used?

Here are some of them:

React Native, Styled-components, Reanimated and Redux
